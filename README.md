This program has the user input numbers to guess the right answer. The numbers are randomly generated. There are multiple difficulty levels that expand the number range to guess from.

This is my take on the game. the game itself meets all of the criteria requested, plus the xtra credit that includes the Custom Guess option. 
I enjoyed playing each level, however I was not fond of the word selection by the Programmer "Your guess is less than my number" its more a personal dislike than the actual meaning of what the sentence is trying to convey. 
Adding a fun twist with the wording would be nice. Besides that' I think the program exceeds the expectations of the requirements.
